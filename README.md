FastAPI ML Model Deployment with HTML Frontend

This project demonstrates how to deploy a machine learning model using FastAPI along with an interactive HTML template for making predictions. A DecisionTreeClassifier trained on custom features is serialized using joblib and served through a lightweight API. The application includes:

📦 Model loading using joblib

🧠 Prediction logic via FastAPI endpoints

🖥️ HTML form for user input (Jinja2 templating)

🚀 Live inference through browser

🐍 Environment setup with venv and dependency management
